# ps4sdk
Modular open source ps4 sdk with user and kernel support

Give me a couple of days for the readme and the complete features (e.g. advanced hooking)
This will no longer be generated in any way. Fork, change (e.g. fix struct padding), provide pull request :)
Also, I will detail the code conventions a bit, which follow what I have seen from sony so far.
This can almost do everything that the old lib can do, and shortly more. It's also much more modular and can hopefully be adapted to all sorts of new exploit circumstances.

Again readme and improvements shortly. Be advised that if you contribute, you have to do so under the License.

I will merge and retire the other repos into a single libps4 (graveyard) repo. Pre-compiled releases may be useful too.
